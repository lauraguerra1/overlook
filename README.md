## Abstract: 
The 'Lavish Living Hotel' website allows users to log in and view their previous, upcoming and current stays at the hotel. The user dashboard will also provide users with insight into how much money thy have spent at the hotel so far. Furthermore, users can search for rooms to book, and filter the results based on date, type of room, and price range.
- Upon login, the fetch API is used to retrieve data about the user who has logged in, and throughout the appliaction network requests are made to create and read data.

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using Test Driven Development.
- Make network requests (using fetch API) to create and read data.
- Implement the use of a project board and collaborate with other students to provide usability tests and code reviews.
